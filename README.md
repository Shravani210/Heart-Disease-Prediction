# Heart Disease Prediction Using Machine Learning

This project predicts whether a person is likely to have heart disease based on medical attributes such as age, cholesterol level, blood pressure, etc. The model is trained using the UCI Heart Disease dataset and saved using joblib for future use.


## üîç Project Overview

Heart disease is a major global health issue. Early risk detection can save lives.  
This project uses a **Logistic Regression** classification model to determine the presence of heart disease (1 = Yes, 0 = No).

## üß† Model Used

- Logistic Regression (Classification)
- StandardScaler applied to normalize features
- Model saved using joblib (`model.joblib`)


## üìà Visualizations Included (EDA)

- Correlation Heatmap
- Age Distribution Plot
- Heart Disease Count Plot
- Chest Pain Type vs Target Comparison

These help understand the feature impact on heart disease.


## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Run

### Step 1: Install Dependencies
pip install pandas numpy seaborn matplotlib scikit-learn joblib

### Step 2: Run the Model Training File
python heart_disease_model.py

After running, it will:

- ‚úÖ Show graphs
- ‚úÖ Train the ML model
- ‚úÖ Save the model as model.joblib
