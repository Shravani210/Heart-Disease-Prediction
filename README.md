# Heart Disease Prediction Using Machine Learning

This project predicts whether a person is likely to have heart disease based on medical attributes such as age, cholesterol level, blood pressure, etc. The model is trained using the UCI Heart Disease dataset and saved using joblib for future use.


## üîç Project Overview

Heart disease is a major global health issue. Early risk detection can save lives.  
This project uses a **Logistic Regression** classification model to determine the presence of heart disease (1 = Yes, 0 = No).

## üß† Model Used

- Logistic Regression (Classification)
- StandardScaler applied to normalize features
- Model saved using joblib (`model.joblib`)


## üìà Visualizations Included (EDA)

- Correlation Heatmap
